						<h3>Movie Night!</h3>
						<p>The Freshman Caucus is hosting our Movie Night on Friday, March 26th, at 5 PM! Right before the break, this will be the perfect opportunity to come watch an incredible performance with your peers, easing into the well-deserved break. And as per a poll we sent out on Facebook, that movie you’ve selected is… Hamilton!</p>
						<p>Here’s a brief synopsis: As a dramatic rendition of the events surrounding Alexander Hamilton in the American War of Independence, the journey of an immigrant rising to the top truly tells his story, brought to life through hip hop, rap, comedy, and dance by the acclaimed singer-songwriter Lin Manuel Miranda.</p>

						<h3>ARISTA Member Applications</h3>
						<p>If you are interested in bettering your community, both within Stuyvesant and throughout NYC, then we highly encourage you to apply. Our members uphold the four pillars of scholarship, character, service, and leadership by volunteering with organizations across the city, leading Office Hours sessions, providing one-on-one peer tutoring, and participating in our 3 committees, among many other opportunities. Although it is a significant commitment, ARISTA members are an important part of the school community, and gain invaluable experience as leaders.</p>
						<p>While ARISTA members have typically consisted of motivated juniors and seniors, we created the brand-new Sophomore Program to give underclassmen a chance to complete service and gain mentorship from upperclassmen ARISTA members. Members of the Sophomore Program have significantly reduced credit requirements.</p>
						<p>All freshmen, sophomores, and juniors with an overall GPA of 92 and above are welcome to apply by creating an account at apply.stuyarista.org. You will be required to write three short essays, which will be used to consider your application along with your activities and community engagement inside and outside of Stuyvesant. <strong>Applications are due on Monday, April 12th at 11:59pm</strong>.</p>
						<p>Applications will be reviewed anonymously by the Executive Council and our Faculty Advisor, Mr. Wisotsky, with decisions released in early May. If you have any other questions, please feel free to email us at stuyaristanyc@gmail.com and check out our website at stuyarista.org.</p>
						<p>We look forward to reading your applications! Best, ARISTA EC</p>
