		  <h2>Our Policies</h2>
		  <p>Here are the policies we plan to implement and uphold over the course of this year. Click on specific policies to find more information.</p>
		</header>
        <div class="box special">
		  <ul class="actions">
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Enforcement of Homework Policy</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>In remote learning, regular courses can assign 60 minutes of homework and AP courses can assign 120 minutes of homework, as we have class every other day in remote learning. However, you might feel a teacher going over the limit. Before taking action, we highly encourage students to use the Spiral of Communication first, detailed in the Homework Policy above. However, if you don’t feel comfortable addressing your issues with your teacher, we will give an option in our biweekly emails to report infringements in the homework policy, with an option to submit anonymously, and we will contact the teacher ASAP to resolve the issue if substantial evidence and reports are given.</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Virtual Study Hall Sessions</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>It can be challenging to study for tests and do assignments alone for many students, especially during remote learning. We want to fix this issue by hosting weekly Study Hall Zoom sessions where students can study together. There will be a host at each Zoom meeting ensuring it will be a quiet and productive workplace for all students to study and work in. Also, if students would like to collaborate and talk to each other, they may request a breakout room with other students either beforehand or in the chat.</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Class Group Chat Center</a>
			    <div class="dropdownee"><br>Communication and Community are a large part of our campaign. As such, we will request that the creators and admins of any group chats share the link to their Facebook, Instagram, Discord, etc. class group chats. Although not mandatory, this will be extremely helpful for any student looking for help and advice from their class and allows for better communication and more of a sense of community among freshmen. This information will then be posted on our website, which we will detail later in, for all to access.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Class Stretch Breaks</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>We have often seen complaints about the schedule from the student body, and sitting in front of a screen for hours is extremely draining and stressful. We cannot mess with the school’s entire schedule, so as an alternative, we will try to advocate for one-minute stretch breaks during classes instead. This would provide a well-deserved break for students for them to relax, use the bathroom, or anything else. We know we cannot mandate this policy and interrupt every teacher’s limited class time, but we’ll request if teachers can allow this policy in their classroom, as it would be extremely beneficial to students and teachers alike.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Club and Extracurricular Schedule</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>Many major clubs schedule meetings at the same time, such as Math Team, Speech and Debate, and MUN. Many students are usually interested and involved in a variety of extracurricular activities, but it is difficult to commit to multiple clubs they’re interested in when their meetings consistently overlap or if they don’t know when the meetings are held. To fix this issue, our platform will create an official club and extracurricular schedule, where major clubs at Stuyvesant can post their meeting time to make sure they don’t overlap with another major club, and if they do, the students will know ahead of time. To carry this plan out, we’ll contact the Clubs and Pubs department of the SU, as well as the leaders of the major clubs to fill in a calendar every month of the meets and events they may have. We understand that this will be difficult to achieve, but we will try our best to enact this policy if we are elected during our time as Freshman Caucus, or at least set it as a precedent for future Caucuses.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Weekly Club Highlights</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>Many clubs aren’t known to the freshmen, and it can be difficult to find a club you’re truly interested in even with the use of StuyActivties. However, we plan to fix this issue with Weekly Club Highlight emails. These emails would include a summary of a variety of clubs submitted by club leaders, as well as appropriate links and dates of their next meetings. Not only would freshmen be able to explore and find clubs that they’re interested in, smaller clubs that normally go unrecognized would also gain more publicity and advertising. That’ll give freshmen a taste of the many clubs given in Stuyvesant, and hopefully help them find their passions. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Teacher Relations Events</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>One of the priorities of our platform is the relationship between students and teachers. This connection is a fundamental part of school life, but hard to form during remote learning. We hope to build a better relationship by hosting events with teachers and their classes, such as game nights playing Among Us, Kahoot, Skribbl.io, and more. We’ll also host recorded interviews with teachers about a variety of topics for all their classes to see. This way, students will be able to connect to their teachers even in remote learning and get to know and see what teachers are like outside the classroom. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Freshman Virtual Field Day</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>The Stuyvesant Big Sib program did a great job hosting the Big Sib Little Sib Virtual Field Day, allowing students to connect with both their peers and upperclassmen. We want to host an event similar to this where we can provide a wide variety of activities students could choose from and bond with other students with similar interests.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Movie and Game Nights</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>To build a larger sense of community among the freshmen class, our platform will host virtual movies and game nights that will allow everyone to relax and bond with each other. We’ll send out a form to the student body with options for which movies they want to watch and games they want to play to ensure students will have a fun and enjoyable time during our events.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Freshman Caucus Meetings Open to All</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>We will hold meetings every other week with the Freshman Caucus team to figure out our plans and reconvene on things we already accomplished. To have complete transparency, students will be able to sign up to attend and listen to the meetings and gain a better understanding of what we plan to do. They can also ask questions or contribute ideas at the end. Meetings will be recorded, so you can always watch the video afterward too!
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Personal Caucus Meetings</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>We understand that new problems constantly arise and there may be problems that we’re not addressing in our initial policies. To solve this, we will enact a feature using Calendly where you will be able to schedule private meetings with one of the Freshman Caucus co-presidents, where we will answer any questions you have or accept suggestions/complaints. If we are elected, we will announce a certain period and day where we are free for meetings, and you will be allowed to apply and schedule a meeting or be put on a waiting list.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Emails and Form</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>As the school years continue, we will be sending out biweekly emails with updates about our progress or any school updates regarding freshmen you should be aware of. These emails will also have a Google Form, which will allow the student body to ask questions, address issues or complaints, suggest events, conduct polls so we can see how freshmen are doing, or just casual polls to lift your spirits after a long week of work.</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Freshman Caucus Website</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>Our website will be updated constantly, and we will make sure to keep it updated with important dates, current and upcoming events, our current plans, and anything else important. It will also be a convenient center for you to access information and resources, such as class group chat links, virtual study guides provided by ARISTA, digital textbooks from the SU, and much more!</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Centralized Learning Platforms</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>After researching and talking to upperclassmen about issues at Stuyvesant before remote learning, one of the most common issues was a lack of centralization of platforms. We understand that teachers have their preferences when it comes to teaching the class, but for the students, it's a hassle having to check all platforms for any notifications of assignments and grades. If we do return to school soon, we would propose that teachers continue to post all their assignments on Google Classroom as they have done now in remote learning. It’s an easy and simple task that makes a huge difference in the student body.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Continuation of Previous Policies</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>We would also like to advocate for policies that previous caucuses have failed to implement. Some of these policies include early entrance from lunch periods and before the school day, and the one earphone policy, where students are allowed to use one earphone in the lunchroom to focus on studying and homework. If we were to come back to school, we believe that we would have a better chance of successfully implementing these policies than past caucuses due to the new Stuyvesant administration under Principal Yu.
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li id="dropdown"><a class="button alt icon">Freshman Party</a>
				<div class="dropdownee"><br>We would love to host a Freshman Party, where freshmen can finally get to meet and have fun with each other in-person. However, we will only host this if conditions become safe for the entire school, as well as permission from the CDC and DOE. But we will try to make this event as successful and fun as possible if we are allowed to, celebrating the end of the pandemic and the official start of a new school!
